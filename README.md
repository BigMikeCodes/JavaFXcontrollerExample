# JavaFXcontrollerExample
A quick and simple example showing how data can be passed between two separate JavaFX controllers. 

The example creates an instance of type Student using the first view and controller. 
If the student was created succesfully then the Student will be displayed in a new window.

This example was made and tested using OpenJDK 11 and maven.
